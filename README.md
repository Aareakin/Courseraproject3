Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is submitted by Yusuf Akintunde Azeez for coursera project 3
It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.
Dataset is Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
The project is to write a CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work
that I performed to clean up the data.
run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as
described in the course project.
Merges the training and the test sets to create just one dataset.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
each variable for each activity and each subject.
aveData.txt is the exported at the end of the work.
